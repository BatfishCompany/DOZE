Sleep is perhaps one of our most important body functions that most people take for granted. What most don't realize however, is that it's an integral part of our limbic system and so dependent is our health on being well-rested that extreme sleep deprivation can even prove lethal.

This app seeks to not only monitor the user's sleeping habits, but also provide keen insight into those habits with suggestions on how the user might improve their overall sleep hygiene. Ideally we would want to offer a more personal product that can offer more sleep-based services.

Current capabilities include:

- Getting a sleep score based on questions answered and score based responses.

- Can add a personal sleep journal.

- Able to add, delete, and update individual sleep scores, as well as the sleep journals.


Things that need to be done:

- Employing authentication so a user needs a username and password to sign into the app (O Auth).

- Graph visualization of sleep data that provides fast information at a glance (ChartJS).

- Give detailed recommendations on how to improve their sleep habits based on their scores.
